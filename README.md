# 🧠 Object Recognition / Classification using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates **object recognition and image classification** using both **traditional machine learning** (HOG + SVM) and **modern deep learning** approaches (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Transformers).  
It is built for research comparison — showing how accuracy and efficiency evolve from traditional to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Dataset support for CIFAR-10 (default) and extendable to ImageNet, COCO, or custom datasets.
- 🧩 Compare Traditional vs Deep Learning Models:
  - HOG + SVM (classical baseline)
  - ResNet / EfficientNet (CNNs)
  - ConvNeXt / Swin Transformer (modern models)
- 📊 Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP.
- 🔍 Visualization: Confusion matrix and Grad-CAM for explainability.
- ⚡ Deployment-ready Streamlit app for testing image recognition interactively.
